    <h1>In this assignment I answered the question "What bodies of water, both lakes and rivers, are affected by highway pollution in Mendocino County, California?"</h1>
    
    <h2>My map: This map shows a 1000ft buffer from the highway, and where that pollution from cars may have the potential to reach bodies of water. I then did a clip to show where this buffer reaches lake Mendocino itself, to show the potential impacts.</h2>
