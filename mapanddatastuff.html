    <h1>In this assignment I answered the question "What bodies of water, both lakes and rivers, are affected by highway pollution in Mendocino County, California?"</h1>
    
    <h2>My map: This map shows a 1000ft buffer from the highway, and where that pollution from cars may have the potential to reach bodies of water. I then did a clip to show where this buffer reaches Lake Mendocino itself, to show the potential impacts.</h2>

    <h2>My Vector Data was sourced from the California Natural Resources Agency, and the California Open Data Portal .</h2>

    <h2>I created a shapefile save of the California highway 1000ft buffer.</h2>

    <h2>I created a shapefile save of the Highway Meets Lake Clip.</h2>

    <h3>The question was answered when examining where this highway pollution may reach bodies of water, looking both at the highway buffer to demonstrate the contact with rivers, as well as using the clip to show contact with Lake Mendocino.</h3>
